# 👋 Hi, I'm Asad Shahzad — Data Scientist | Problem Solver | Machine Learning Enthusiast

🎓 Recently completed my Master’s in Data Science, and I'm passionate about **turning data into impact**. My goal? To build intelligent systems that solve real-world problems and create meaningful change.

## 🔍 What I Do

- 📊 **Data Analysis & Storytelling** – I turn raw data into powerful insights using Python, Pandas, SQL, and data visualization tools.
- 🤖 **Machine Learning & AI** – From regression to neural networks, I build models that learn, adapt, and predict with precision.
- 🛠️ **End-to-End Projects** – From data collection to model deployment (yes, I love Streamlit & Flask), I do the full stack of data science.
- 📦 **Clean, Reproducible Code** – My notebooks and scripts follow best practices, with clear documentation and reproducibility in mind.
- 🔁 **Constantly Learning** – Staying updated with new tools and methods (LangChain, LLMs, vector databases, etc).
